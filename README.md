# spotify-playlist-generator
This Python program generates a personalized playlist based on the most streamed songs and artists on Spotify. It uses two CSV files, songs.csv (top 2,500 most streamed songs) and artists.csv (top 3,000 most streamed artists), to tailor recommendations according to user preferences.
